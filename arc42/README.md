This directory is based on the ARC42 template, but some warnings have been fixed
and code has been splitted into different files.

In addition, section links have been removed because it is possible to use the
implicit hyperlinks and title markups have been modified using the [python
documentation standards](https://devguide.python.org/documenting/#sections)
